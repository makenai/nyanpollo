# Video Conversion Scripts

These are a couple of scripts to combine and time videos from the nyanpollo-1 flight.

- index.js - this is the first attempt, trying to create a real time video with filler movies and fade transitions. This didn't work out well and was abandonned.
- index-compressed.js - this was attempt number 2 and just sticks all the movies together, generating a `timeAdjustments.json` file you can use with [Nyanpollo Player](https://github.com/makenai/nyanpollo-player).
