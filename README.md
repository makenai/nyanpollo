#Nyanpollo Mission

This is JavaScript software to run on a Raspberry Pi payload of a high altitude balloon.

I'll have a blog post with a lot of detail soon, but for now this is all there is.

See [JavaScript in Near Space](https://github.com/makenai/JS-in-near-Space) for some slides on this topic.

See [Nyanpollo Player](https://github.com/makenai/nyanpollo-player) for a demo of how to replay the data created with this software.

See [my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/makenai/sets/72157660687266831) for photos of the mission.

See [my twitter](https://twitter.com/makenai) to ask questions about this or other things.
